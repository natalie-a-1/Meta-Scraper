## Adding Your Own Test Images

You can add your own images to this folder. Images from digital cameras, smartphones, or downloaded from the internet typically contain rich metadata that can be cleaned with this extension.

- Professional camera photos (contain camera settings)
- Stock photos (contain copyright information)

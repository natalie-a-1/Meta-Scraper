## 🛡️ Why Cleaning Image Metadata Is Critical

Modern digital images contain a surprising amount of hidden metadata that could compromise your privacy:

| Metadata Type | Privacy Risk |
|---------------|--------------|
| **GPS Location** | Reveals exact coordinates where the photo was taken |
| **Device Information** | Exposes your camera/phone model and unique identifiers |
| **Creation Time** | Shows precisely when the photo was taken |
| **Software Details** | Reveals what apps you use to edit photos |
| **Author Info** | Can include your name, email, or other personal details |

**Real-world consequences of uncleaned metadata:**
- 🌎 Accidentally revealing your home location
- 🔍 Leaking information during sensitive document sharing
- 🔐 Exposing organizational details in professional contexts
- ⏱️ Revealing timeline information that should remain private

Meta-Scraper protects you by completely removing this hidden data while preserving image quality.
